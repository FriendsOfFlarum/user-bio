            allowFormatting_help: By design, this formatting is separate from post formatting. If the BBCode and/or Markdown extensions are enabled, they will be available to format the bio. No images or embeds are allowed. Extensions that add to the Flarum formatter must *explicitly* add support for the bio formatter.
